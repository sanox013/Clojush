;; The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing. In particular,
;; they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it
;; is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90.
;; Given an int temperature and a boolean is_summer, return true if the
;; squirrels play and false otherwise.
